I am a Distributed systems researcher, working with Serverless computing, graph databases and storage backends at Telecom SudParis. My primary interest lies at the intersection of distributed systems and connected data.  

I am particularly interested in the design, implementation, and verification of replication and consistency protocols for distributed systems. During my PhD, I worked on multi-granularity locking in dynamic hierarchies and developed CALock, a new locking protocol for parallel threads over  hierarchical data. I am collaborating with researchers from NOVA LINCS and RPTU Kaiserslautern to specify the correctness of transactional database backends. Alongside, with Telecom Sud-Paris on
designing and developing a schema-first, local-first graph system to facilitate collaborative knowledge graph editing. Email me, lets chat about it!

I got my PhD from Sorbonne University working with the [DELYS](https://team.inria.fr/delys/) team in LIP6/Inria in Paris. Before that, i was with the [AGPL](https://pl.cs.uni-kl.de/homepage/en/) team in TU Kaiserslautern where I did my Master's thesis on [AntidoteDB](https://www.antidotedb.eu).
