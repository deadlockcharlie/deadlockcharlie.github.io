### Where did it all begin for me?

I grew up in India, in a very small town. No computers, no internet, very simple life. I was very academically inclined from the start, not because i liked studying but rather because i liked winning. It was a rat race for me. Prepare well for exams, get good grades and eventually, you'll end up kind of successful. Then in 2008, computers and broadband internet came. I still remember the first computer we got a home.  If memory serves me right, it was a pentium 4 CPU with a mere 1GB of RAM. I had been exposed to programming before in Basic and LOGO (shout-out to everyone who remembers it). Then came JAVA. Suddenly it was this magical language with which i could make a computer do exactly as i wanted. 

One thing about me, which might be useful to understand the context of this rant, is that i hate not understanding things. I cannot just know stuff without developing an understanding for it. This is one of the main reasons, i hated mathematics in school. THe way we are taught math is really bad. Look at a problem, think of a formula to apply and come up with a solution. I just couldn't do it. Other than maths, every course, i'd consistently get over 90% marks. Maths however, i barely would pass with 60%, sometimes even lower. 

In India, when one graduates from grade 10 (10th class as we call it), we need to choose a stream. Math if you're intelligent, Biology if you hate medicine and Commerce otherwise. Now, Biology education is prohibitively expensive for a majority of the population. So, everyone chooses maths, I did too. 4 years of engineering, then a stable job and you're set for life. I laugh now looking at how and where i ended up. 

### From hating maths to loving it
Once in college, i had a bit more independence to decide what i wanted to study. I wasn't in an amazing academic campus where the class load was very high, so getting good grades was easy. There was still a nagging feeling in my head that kept reminding me "You're not doing enough". Then came the courses about linear algebra, differential calculus etc. If i thought math education in school was bad, this was on another level of badness. I had no idea why we were learning all this mumbo jumbo when all we need to do is program stuff (A question, i am often asked by students still. Maybe we need to improve?). -->
